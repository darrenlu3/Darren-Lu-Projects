This is my CS 111 Lab 0 project, a warmup program that copies input to output with IO redirection. Option flags allow different capabilities.

README: file containing description of files and smoketest explanations

lab0.c: source file for lab0 project

backtrace.png: shows lab0 with --segfault call and associated stack-trace

breakpoint.png: shows lab0 with --segfault call and a breakpoint set in gdb with variable inspection

Makefile: compiles the lab0 executable, runs smoketest, cleans up files and compresses files into a tarball.

smoketest.sh: a bash script intended to test functionality of lab0

smoketest tests:
	  normal function copying stdin to stdout
	  --input flag with no argument, nonexistent file, and nominal function
	  --output flag with no argument, inaccessible file and nominal function
	  --input flag combined with --output flag
	  testing --segfault flag and whether or not input is copied to output with it
	  testing --catch flag with segfault flag
	  testing for unrecognized arguments

Some code snippets were taken from Week 1 slides provided by Section 1E TA
