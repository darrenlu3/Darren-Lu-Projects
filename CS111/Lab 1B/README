README: file containing description of files

lab1b-client.c: source file for lab1b project: client side

lab1b-server.c: source file for lab1b project: server side

Makefile: compiles the lab1b-client and lab1b-server executables, cleans up files, and compresses files into a tarball.

I could not get the log option working, and I could not properly process decompressed commands. Wondering if I could get a bit of partial credit for these parts?
